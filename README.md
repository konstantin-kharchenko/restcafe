# restcafe
The client makes an Order for lunch (chooses from the menu) and indicates the time
when he would like to receive an order. The system shows the price of the Order and
offers to pay from a client account or in cash upon receipt
order. Points are awarded to the client for pre-orders
loyalty. If the Client places an order and does not pick it up, then the points
loyalty is removed up to its blocking. The client can evaluate
every order and leave feedback. The administrator manages the menu,
sets/removes bans/bonuses/points for Clients.
